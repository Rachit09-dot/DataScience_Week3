# Python Assignment – Week 3 (Data Science / AI Internship)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my **Week 3 Python Assignment** completed as part of a **Data Science / AI Internship**. The assignment is designed to evaluate Python programming skills across multiple real‑world scenarios such as date handling, mathematical computation, file handling, data processing, and API integration.

Each exercise is implemented in a **separate Python file**, following clean coding practices, proper error handling, and detailed comments for clarity.

## 📝 Exercise Details

### 🔹 Exercise 1: Age Calculator

* Accepts birth date in **mm/dd/yyyy** format
* Validates date input
* Calculates current age
* Converts date to **European format (dd/mm/yyyy)**
* Handles invalid inputs gracefully

### 🔹 Exercise 2: Prime Number Generator

* Accepts a range of positive integers
* Finds all prime numbers in the range
* Displays output in a formatted manner (10 numbers per line)
* Includes proper input validation and error handling

### 🔹 Exercise 3: Student Marks Processor

* Reads student data from a text file
* Computes overall marks using weighted logic
* Assigns grades based on rules
* Uses **NumPy structured arrays**
* Sorts students by overall marks
* Writes processed results to an output file
* Displays grade statistics

### 🔹 Exercise 4: Weather Data Fetcher & Analyzer

* Uses **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch real‑time weather data
* Analyzes temperature, wind speed, and humidity
* Generates weather condition summaries
* Logs data into a **CSV file**
* Implements API error handling and Unicode-safe file writing
